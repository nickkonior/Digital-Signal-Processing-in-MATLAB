MATLAB scripts to implement DSP tasks

Er1. Creates the distinct signal x[n] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] in 6 subplots where  
a)x[n] b)x[n-5] c)x[n+4] d)x[-n] e)x[n/2] f)x[2n]  
  
Er2. Creates the distinct signal y[n] = 2*u[n-(6)] - 8*δ[n-1]  
for n = -19 : 21  
  
Er3. Creates the distinct signal  
 x[n] = 3*n, -5<=n<=-1  
 x[n] = e^n, -1<=n<=2  
 x[n] = sqrt(24)  
  
Er4. 






 Er9. Creates the following :  
 x1[n] = cos(0.2*pi*n + pi/3)  
 x2[n] = cos(0.1*pi*n + pi/4)  
 x3[n] = cos(0.01*n + pi/5)  
 y[n] = x1[n] + x2[n]  
 z[n] = x1[n] + x2[n] + x3[n]
